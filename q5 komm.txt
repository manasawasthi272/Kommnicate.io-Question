Q-If you start a software company name two people from your batch whom you will choose partner and why?
Ans:When you start a company the member one should choose should be hardworking and most importantly trustworthy also.I will choose my two batchmates Vaibhav and Kushagra for the job.As 
both of them are very hardworking and they have great knowledge in their respective field.They have the abilty to face difficult scenarios and come out from them with flying colours.Both
of them work in unison which is an very important for success of a software company.We all have trust between us and we always stand with the decison that an individual take and do blame 
each other if any bad thing occurs,these are the qualities of a good work environment that help us to take most out of us.
